## Context

Before going into the movie, I had already heard online about the very positive reception of the movie, so my expectations were high going into it. Like really high, but I think I can comfortably say that the movie met and surpassed those expectations. I had already read the manga a little, but just until halfway through volume 6, so I didn't know much about what to expect story-wise.

I'll try my best to avoid spoilers but I won't give any guarantees. I do want to talk about some of the aspects that made the movie so enjoyable for me.

## Story

The movie can be broadly divided into two segments: the first half is made up of slice of life segments focusing on Denji and his interactions with other characters, while the second half is more action-oriented. I think both halves were executed really well, and they complemented each other nicely.

Fujimoto showed that he can handle character-driven stories just as well as action-packed ones, and the movie did a great job of balancing both elements. The first halve reminded (maybe just because of the changed art style) of Fujimotos earlier work "Look Back", which also recently received an anime adaptation. Denji's character was fleshed out nicely compared to season 1 of the anime, and I felt more connected to him as a protagonist.

Reze's character and story both fit well together so that I think Fujimoto's goal of attachment and (spoiler) subsequent heartbreak was achieved well. When I first watched the movie in german dub, the cringe factor of the dub made it harder to get attached to Reze, but when I rewatched it in japanese with subtitles, I understood her character much better.

I took a picture during the movie (don't tell anyone) of one of the most important scenes in the movie, which I will just put here:

## Animation and Art Style

The art style for the anime was changed for the movie, which I think fit the tone of this movie, though I am not one of the people who disliked the original art style of the anime.

And as expected from MAPPA, the animation quality was crazy good. Not just the action scenes, but also the slice of life parts had really fluid and expressive animation.

The fight scenes of the second half had some of the most action-packed animation slices I've seen in a while. There were some really cool camera angles and movements that made the fights feel really dynamic and intense.

The absolute chaos of the (spoiler) typhoon fight with Denji's and Beam's team work was animated so well. In terms of action animation it even surpasses Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 for me, especially when it comes to polish. I don't know who MAPPA sold their soul to to make this movie with a budget of just 4 million USD, but I won't complain.

## Soundtrack

Jesus Christ, I love this soundtrack. The music in this movie was composed by Kensuke Ushio, who also did the soundtrack for the anime adaptation of "A Silent Voice" and "Devilman Crybaby". Songs like "in the pool", "the city mouse and the country mouse" or "slow summer eve" are just absolutely heartbreaking and fit the slice of life segments perfectly.

There were even some horror elements during the climax of the slice of life portion of the movie that were really well made. "sweet danger" made me shiver in my seat when the scene came on in the cinema.

And of course the action music was perfect as well. They even played an old ending theme from season 1 of the anime during one of the fight scenes, which was a nice touch. Kensuke Ushio really outdid himself with this soundtrack.

The opening and ending themes were also really good. "IRIS OUT" continued the same energetic vibe as "Kick Back" from season 1. The ending "Jane Doe" was also perfectly fitting for the ending of the movie, it made you want to not leave during the credits.

## Conclusion

So, the movie was so good that I went to see it twice, with subtitles the second time. I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie to literally everyone. If I got the chance, I would gladly watch it again a third, fourth, or fifth time. I don't want to miss the opportunity to see this movie in theaters again before it leaves the cinemas.
